**1. How you prefer to communicate (e.g., discord, whatsapp), how responsive you expect 
your partner to be (e.g., respond the same day), and how responsive you will be.**
We will be communicating through Instagram. We'll expect each other to respond usually 
within at least 12 hours.

**2. Whether you prefer meeting in-person or online.** 
We will priortize meeting in person, but meet online if there are schedule conflicts.

**3. Your work style.  For example, whether you like to get your work done early, 
or leave tasks closer to the deadline.**
We would both prefer to start our work early and work in chunks, rather than 
leaving anything to the last minute.

**4. Whether you expect to have any weekly meetings outside of lab, and at what time.**
We will meet around 3:30 on Wednesdays.

**5. The frequency you will push your work to GitHub and open pull requests. In particular, 
reflect on what a "unit of work" means to you and how you will know it is ready to be reviewed 
by your partner.**
We will push our work to GitHub when we have changed/added some functionality in our code. 
For example, we would push to GitHub after adding a new method, but not after fixing some syntax.

**6. A list of hard deadlines (e.g., large assignments or midterms in other courses) where you'll 
have less capacity to contribute to the project, and what strategies you will use to ensure the 
7project checkpoints are completed equitably and on time.**
We are both taking CPSC 304, so we both have a midterm on February 24th and March 25th.
To ensure the checkpoints are completely in a timely manner, we will prioritize starting 
our work early and communicating openly with each other.
