This project was developed as part of CPSC 310: Introduction to Software Engineering at UBC. Insight UBC is a web application that allows users to explore and 
analyze data about UBC courses and campus rooms. Through the user interface, users can upload ZIP files containing course section data and gain insights through 
interactive statistics and visualizations.

The project was a collaboration between two team members. My contributions focused on implementing the functionality for uploading and parsing course and room datasets, 
building a comprehensive test suite, and designing and developing the frontend interface.
